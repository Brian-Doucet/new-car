# new-car :car:

The time arrived for my wife and I to replace our 13 year-old car. I created this project
to document my process for collecting and analyzing data on cars that we were interested in so we could try and find cars that might be a good deal based on price and mileage. 

We narrowed the selection down to four different car models. For our research we decided to use [cars.com](www.cars.com) to aggregate as much information as we could about price, mileage, make, model, trim options, and dealership reviews.

In order to get the project up and running quickly, I decided to use the [Web Scraper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scraper/jnhgnonknehpejjnehehllkliplmbmhn?hl=en) chrome extension offered by [webscraper.io](https://webscraper.io/) to quickly scrape the raw data from [cars.com](www.cars.com) with the help of this great blog post by [Scrape Hero](https://www.scrapehero.com/scrape-car-data-from-cars-com/).

Project Goals & Scope:
* Scrape data on active car listings from cars.com
* Aggregate all of the data files (4 total, one for each car model)
* Clean and transform the data
* Analyze the data to look for insights on cars that may be overpriced or a great deal
